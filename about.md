PW Temple Ltd started as a small, family-run business over forty years ago.    Our success is down to hard work, attention to detail and the use of quality tradesmen.

Our craftsmanship and project management are strongly supported by our directly-employed or subcontracted plasterers, stonemasons and joiners who all produce high quality finished work -  all of them key areas during any contract.

With our wide range of experience we comfortably cover all aspects of any conversion, renovation or refurbishment at any scale.

## The Team

We have a great team, very dedicated and highly skilled; all invested in the ongoing success of our business. Individual skills are plentiful and wide-ranging and our particular strengths are working together as a whole, priding ourselves in the quality of our finished work. The same applies to our team of regular sub-contractors.

## Get in touch

Get in touch with us to discuss any aspect of your planned building work.   We look forward to hearing from you.
